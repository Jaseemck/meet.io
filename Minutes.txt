Signals travel from the first layer (the input layer), to the last layer (the output layer), possibly after traversing the layers multiple times.The original goal of the ANN approach was to solve problems in the same way that a human brain would.However, over time, attention moved to performing specific tasks, leading to deviations from biology.An ANN is based on a collection of connected units or nodes called artificial neurons, which loosely model the neurons in a biological brain.Neurons may have a threshold such that a signal is sent only if the aggregate signal crosses that threshold.
